You can create your own quiz categories using a notecard!

Each line of the notecard should contain a question and answers in the following format:

<Question>  <Correct answer>  <Incorrect answer 1>  <Incorrect answer 2>  ...

That is:
- The text of the question.
- Two spaces.
- The correct answer.
- Two spaces.
- However many incorrect answers you wish to include (typically one for a true/false question, or three for multiple choice), each separated by two spaces.

Save the notecard and place it in the quiz machine with the script, and it will appear as a category when starting a new quiz!

BE SURE THERE ARE NO EXTRA LINES/SPACES! Use the notecard validator to verify the notecard is correct before using it.
